# Analyze Supermarket Data Across the Country - Company XYZ

This data analysis project was done on **Company XYZ**'s data. The company owns three branches in the major cities across the country.

Each of the three branches recorded sales information for 3 months in the hope that this data would be analyzed to help the company understand sales trends and determine its growth, as the rise of supermarkets competition is seen to increase.

In this project, I have analyzed the recorded data to help the company make guided decisions.

# Project Steps

I took the following steps in analyzing the recorded data:

## Load Datasets

1. I read the location and name of each CSV file into my work environment.
2. I combined the datasets into a single CSV.
3. I loaded the concatenated CSV files into a Pandas dataframe.

## Data Exploration

Here I familiarized myself with the data and tried to find useful insights by:

1. checking the number of rows in the loaded dataframe
2. getting the descriptive statistics of the loaded dataframe
3. checking for missing values
4. printing out the datatype of each row in the dataframe
5. analyzing datetime colmns
6. grouping and aggregating rows in the dataframe

## Visualization and Communication

Visualization helps to get more familiar with the data as well as communicate findings to stakeholders. 

I used various types of charts to visualize the loaded dataframe including; box plots, categorical plots, line graphs and different forms of bar charts.
